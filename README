Very simple picture reorganisator.


Edit appsettings with :

	=> SourceFiles : directory where picture are messy stored 
	=> TargetPath : Directory where picture should be store as :
		 YYYY \ MM \ Image

At first try, check about Exif metadta. Then try to parse filename to get date at format : YYYYMMDD or DDMMYYYY.

Need .net sdk 6.0 to build / run.

To lauch : dotnet run when inside project folder, with appsettings.json as the first arguement.

Used for me in order to sort image from upload with nextcloud.
